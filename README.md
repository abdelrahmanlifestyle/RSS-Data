## Here is some notes about the implementation:-
-The animation is implemented by the animate.css library.
-CNN logo is applied as a default image for missing images from the RSS.
-Bootstrap is used for the responsive view.
-View more button is visible only if there is more data.
-Data is fetched from RSS in the opening once as requested and the View more button will show the rest of unlisted data in the view by 7 each press.
